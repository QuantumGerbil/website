				<section name="about">In 2009 I graduated from the University of Abertay Dundee in Scotland with a BSc in Computer Games Technology. For a time I worked on a few projects using C++ and C# that didn't go anywhere. In 2010 I joined the US Navy where I learned many things to include leadership skills, operational risk management, and to work both solo and with a team. I left the Navy in 2019 where I then worked as a systems administrator. In 2021 I started working as a Digital Archivist preserving and digitizing documents for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.</section>
